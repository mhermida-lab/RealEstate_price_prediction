# Real estate price prediction

### The objective of this project is to develop a prediction model that allows predicting apartment values from data of a real estate leading company from Argentina. The data is from Buenos Aires city housing market database.

The project has been divided into four stages:

- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Feature selection and feature engineering
- Model selection
- Model tuning
- Deployment

### Each stage will be presented with a Jupyter Notebook in order to explain each step and to showcase the code needed to handle the dataset.
